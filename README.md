## 2. Frequently Asked Questions

Q. How can I contribute to the Kotlin IDEA plugin?
A. We accept Pull Requests. Please read our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

Q. Kotlin IDEA plugin sources are used to be inside the [JetBrains/kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) repository. What happened?  
A. We decided to split release cycles for the Kotlin compiler and the IDEA plugin. Now, the majority of new features will arrive together
with updates of IntelliJ IDEA.

Q. But the plugin sources are still in [JetBrains/kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin).  
A. Code transition is in progress. We will delete the IDE plugin sources from the old repository when we decide it is a good time to do so.

Q. What will happen with Pull Requests submitted to the [JetBrains/kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) or [JetBrains/intellij-kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-kotlin) repository?  
A. We will process all existing PRs and replicate commits in the new repository. However, all new PRs to the Kotlin IDEA plugin code
should be done only in [JetBrains/intellij-community](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) repository.
