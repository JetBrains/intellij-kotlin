Reports binary expressions consisting of different operators
without parentheses. Such expressions can be less readable due to different precedence rules of operators.
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
fun foo(b: Boolean?, i: Int?) {
    val x = b ?: i == null // evaluated as `(b ?: i) == null`
    val y = i ?: 0 + 1 // evaluated as `i ?: (0 + 1)`
}
